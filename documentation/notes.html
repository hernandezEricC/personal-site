    software focused. -->
<p>
    ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a detail-obsessed Software Engineer who thrives on clean code,
    clever design, and making things just work. My background spans front-end and
    back-end development, automated test frameworks, and system integration; especially
    in high-stakes, highly regulated environments like medical devices.
</p>
<p>
    I have a special knack for refactoring tangled code into elegant, maintainable
    solutions and love applying solid software design principles and OOP best practices
    to every project I touch. Whether it's organizing complex systems, building
    reusable components, or streamlining test pipelines, I'm all about writing code
    that's not just functional, but thoughtful and scalable.
</p>
<p>
    I take pride in collaborating across teams to build software that's not only reliable
    but a joy to work with; behind the scenes and on the front end. My ideal project?
    One that challenges me to improve systems, sharpen design patterns, and deliver
    something truly impactful.
</p>
<p>
    Let's build something great and organized together.
