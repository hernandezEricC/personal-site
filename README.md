# PersonalSite

##  Purpose
This repository marks the beginning of my journey into web development. 
My goal is to build a strong foundation in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** before incorporating
modern front-end libraries and frameworks. Through this project, I aim to deepen my
understanding of core web technologies by building a personal website from the ground up.
